# Oasis Spaces
Oasis Spaces is designed to provide users the ability to create and track their lists in order to organize their lives. Users can create different kinds of lists ranging from to-do lists to bucket lists. Once an item or list is completed, users can check it off.

## Planning/Coding Experience
As a group we first created a team culture code and planned out how we wanted to approach this project in terms of prioritizing features for our application. We decided to mob code and work on the features together as a team.

We first worked on the wireframes based on the user stories. Then, we started to work on the backend API, which can be found here: https://github.com/SitBackN-React/oasis-spaces

Once the backend API was completed, we worked on the front end by first testing the authentication portion. Afterwards, we built our routes and components for the list model and item subdocument by completing the CRUD features. We also included redirect links in order to have a smooth user interface experience.

Lastly, we worked on the styling using React bootstrap and CSS, created the background image, and deployed our application.

## Unsolved Problems
We still need to update the checkbox feature to include a state so that the checkmarks can remain on the page when viewed again.
